## Ansible

Ansible is an open-source automation tool used for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. This section contains basic playbooks, role configurations, and examples of how Ansible can be used to automate system administration tasks.

### Labs:
- **Playbook for Installing Apache Web Server**
- **Managing Users and Groups**
- **Automating Software Installation**

## Docker

Docker allows you to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. This section covers the basics of Docker containers, images, and orchestrating multi-container applications.

### Labs:
- **Dockerizing a Simple Web Application**
- **Creating Docker Images**
- **Docker Compose for Multi-container Environments**

## Kubernetes (K8s)

Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform used to deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications. In this section, you'll find configurations and practices for deploying apps on Kubernetes clusters.

### Labs:
- **Setting up a Local Kubernetes Cluster (Minikube)**
- **Creating Pods, Deployments, and Services**
- **Helm Charts for Kubernetes Deployment**

---

## Jenkins

Jenkins is an open-source automation server used to build, test, and deploy applications. This section covers the use of Jenkins for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).

### Labs:
- **Setting Up Jenkins for CI/CD Pipelines**
- **Creating a Simple Build Pipeline**
- **Integrating Jenkins with GitHub for Automated Builds**

---

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites:
- **Docker**: Make sure Docker is installed on your system for container-based labs.
- **Kubernetes**: Install Minikube or have access to a Kubernetes cluster for K8s-related labs.
- **Jenkins**: A running Jenkins server (you can use Docker for local setup).
- **Ansible**: Install Ansible on your local machine for playbook executions.
